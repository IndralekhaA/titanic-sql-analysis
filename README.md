# Titanic Survival Analysis Using SQL

This project explores the Titanic dataset using MySQL to uncover survival patterns by gender, class, age, and embarkation port. It simulates a real-world database audit and provides insights using analytical SQL queries.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `titanic_analysis.sql`: All SQL queries used for analysis.
- `titanic_report.md`: Detailed write-up including objectives, methods, and findings.
- `screenshots/`: Output screenshots from MySQL Workbench.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Overall survival rate: **40.62%**
- Female survival rate: **75.48%**
- 1st-class passenger survival rate: **65.59%**
- Survivors were slightly younger (28.34 vs 30.63 years)
- Majority boarded at Southampton

## 💻 Tools Used

- MySQL Workbench
- SQL (DDL, DML, aggregation, CASE, filtering)

## 📄 Report Summary

In this project, I conducted a complete SQL-based analysis of the Titanic dataset. The data was imported into a structured table, cleaned, and explored using SQL queries to reveal trends in survival across demographic and travel features. This project highlights SQL skills such as data wrangling, integrity checks, and business-focused insights.

## 📸 Screenshots

Screenshots of queries and results can be found in the `screenshots/` folder.
